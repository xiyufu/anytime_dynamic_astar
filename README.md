# anytime_dynamic_astar
Anytime dynamic A* is an algorithm that combines D* Lite and Anytime Repairing A*. Suitable for fast path planning and replanning during robot movement.
This repo tries to implement this algorithm togehter with peripheral components as described in the paper: 
Likhachev, M., & Ferguson, D. (2009). Planning long dynamically feasible maneuvers for autonomous vehicles. The International Journal of Robotics Research, 28(8), 933-945.
